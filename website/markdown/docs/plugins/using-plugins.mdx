# Plugins

With plugins you can extend Tuist to add support for custom project description helpers, custom templates, and much more!
Plugins are meant to be separate isolated directories that contain custom code or templates used to extend existing Tuist functionality. 
You may use plugins that exist locally on your machine or better yet, upload them to the internet and keep them under source control.

## Using plugins

In order to tell Tuist you'd like to use plugins in your project, you can start by defining the plugins in the [`Config.swift`](/docs/usage/config/) manifest.

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let config = Config(
    plugins: [
        .local(path: "../Plugins/MyPlugin"),
        .git(url: "https://url/to/plugin.git", tag: "1.0.0"),
        .git(url: "https://url/to/plugin.git", sha: "e34c5ba")
    ]
)
```
By defining plugins in the [`Config.swift`](/docs/usage/config/) manifest Tuist is able to collect, cache and use your plugins to add or extend functionality.

## Example

Let's say we have a plugin called `MyTuistPlugin`. This plugin is designed to add functionality to `ProjectDescription`, in this example the plugin will add a new method to `Project` which allow us to define an application very quickly.
This plugin is stored in git on some remote server, and we'd like to use version `1.0.0` of the plugin.

We must first configure Tuist to use our plugin, we can do that by adding the plugin to the [`Config.swift`](/docs/usage/config/) manifest.

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let config = Config(
    plugins: [
        .git(url: "https://url/to/MyTuistPlugin", tag: "1.0.0")
    ]
)
```

Now we can run [`tuist generate`](/docs/commands/generate/) to have Tuist pull our plugin from source control and add it to our project.
With the config updated and the plugin fetched we can now start using our plugin when writing our `Project.swift`.

```swift
import ProjectDescription
import MyTuistPlugin

let project = Project.app(name: "MyCoolApp", platform: .iOS)
```

As you can see now we can use the `MyTuistPlugin` by importing it into the `Project.swift`. Thanks to plugins we are able to reuse project description helpers across multiple projects and teams!
