# Statistics

Tuist is an open-source developed by people that devote their free time.
Therefore it's important that the limited time that we can dedicate to the project we use it wisely.
However, it's impossible to prioritize work without data about how users use the tool.
Questions like, _can we deprecate this version of Xcode?_, or _should we invest more into the focus command?_ are hard to answer without data.

For that reason Tuist has **built-int anonymous statistics** about how users use the tool. Tuist sends events in the background to BigQuery,
and the data is publicly available through the [stats website](https://stats.tuist.io).

Although one can find the list of events that we send in the Tuist's codebase, for the sake of transparency with Tuist's users we included them in a more concise and centralized format in the following section.

## Events

- **Generate:** The command is sent when the generate command finishes running. If it finishes successfully, we include the time it took to generate the project.
